# CSE322 Term Project BUET CSE Level3-Term2

This repository contains the term project of CSE322 (Computer Networks) course I did on Wireless Network Simulation on NS3. 


### Task A

Task A High Rate (802.11) contains a basic wireless adhoc topology where various metrics (throughput, end to end delay, packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio, etc) are measured. Trace of congestion window (cwnd vs time) also can be plotted. The parameters are kept variable, for the user's convenience. For this Task, the simulations were run on TCP-Vegas.

Task A Low Rate (802.15) contains a wireless topology of a Low Rate Personal Area Network (LRWPAN). Various metrics (throughput, end to end delay, packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio, etc) are measured here as well. The parameters are kept variable, for the user's convenience.

### Task B

Task B contains an improvement for TCP-Vegas for wireless adhoc networks, named "TCP-VegasW". Various metrics (throughput, end to end delay, packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio, etc) are measured. The parameters are kept variable, for the user's convenience.
